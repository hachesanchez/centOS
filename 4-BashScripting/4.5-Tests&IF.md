# 4.5. Implement Logical evaluation and conditions: TESTS and the `if` clause

## Exit code in Bash

- If a program exists, it provides an exit code, which indicates the success or failure of its execution.
- Exit code 0 is considered true, and any non-zero value is considered false
- Exit code 0 -> success,
- non-zero value (e.g., 1, or anything else) -> failure
- You can access the exit code of the last command using the
  special variable `$?`

**Exit code in C++**

- If you have programmed in C++ before, the exit code is the return value of the main function. Example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) { // insert code here...
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n"; return 0;
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exit code usually gets truncated to the lower 8 bit (meaning: Integer range from 0-255)
> Certain shells might use exit codes from above 126 for signals, thus: Exit code should be between 0 and 125

## Chaining commands

- We can combine multiple commands in the following way:
- [command1] && [command2]
- [command1]; [command2]
- This works on the CLI, but also in Bash scripts. It is especially useful for CLI usage though, the difference is that:
- `;` >> always executes the next command
- `&&` >> only executes the next command, if the first commands exit code is 0

## Chaining with OR: ||

- We can also combine multiple commands with a logical OR: [command1] || [command2]
- If the first command executes successfully (exit code 0): The second command will not be executed
- If the first command executes unsuccessfully (exit code not equal to 0): The second command will be executed

## Testing values

- If we want to test values, we can use [[...]] for this: [[condition]]. This will then set the exit code:
  - 0: If the condition has been fulfilled
  - 1: If the condition has not been fulfilled. Example:
- `[["hello" == "hello"]] ` >> Condition fulfilled, exit code will be 0
- `[["hello" == "world"]]` >> Condition not fulfilled, exit code will be 1
- `[["hello" != "world"]]` >> Condition fulfilled, exit code will be 0
- `[["${name}" == "max"]]` >> This depends on the contents of the variable name

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Word splitting and pathname expansion are disabled within [[...]]
> But other expansions, such as variable expansion / command substitution are still working!

## The `if` command

- The if statement is used for conditional branching based on the result of a test or exit status
- Syntax: `if command; then`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It does not matter for the `if` how the exit code has been generated bur, we can just use:
> `if [["${name}" == "Max"]]; then`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

read -p 'What day is today? ' day

day=$(echo "$day" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$day" == "friday" ]]; then
  echo "yeiiii, friyeiiii!"
else
  echo "not yet"
fi
```

## The `elif` statement

- The elif statement allows you to evaluate multiple conditions in a series of if statements. Syntax:

```bash
if command1; then
    # Code to execute if command1 is true (exit code = 0)
    elif command2; then
    # Code to execute if command2 is true (exit code = 0)
    else
    #Code to execute if no previous conditions are true
fi
```

- Conditions are evaluated from top to bottom
- Once a condition is found to be true, the corresponding code block is executed, and all remaining conditions are skipped

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

if ping -c 5 nonexistentdomain123456.com; then
  echo 'nonexistentdomain123456.com could be pinged'
elif ping -c 5 estudio-h.es; then
  echo 'ESTUDIO-H could be pinged'
else
  echo 'no server could be pinged'
fi
```

## Testing strings

- To check if a variable is set to a specific string: `[["${filename}" == 'data.csv']]`
- To check if a variable is of length zero:
  - This one would work: `[["${filename}" == '']] `
  - But this is preferred: `[[-z "${filename}"]]`
- To check if a variable is not of length zero:
  - This one would work: `[["${filename}" != '']]`
  - But this one is preferred: `[[-n "${filename}"]]`

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, `[[...]]` also supports `=`
> It is treated in the same way as `==`
> Thus, those would be equivalent:
>
> - `[["${filename}" == 'data.csv']]`
> - `[["${filename}" = 'data.csv']]`
>   But we should try to always use `==` as it's more clear

```bash
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ [[ -z "${frijol}" ]]; echo $?
0
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ frijol=love
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ [[ -z "${frijol}" ]]; echo $?
1
```

```bash
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ read -p 'Your name?: ' name
Your name?: Julia
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ [[ "${name}" == H* ]]
hgarcia@localhost Linux-udemy$ echo $?
1
```

## Pattern matching

- We can also check if a pattern matches: `[["file.txt" == *.txt]]`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Filename expansion is disabled within `[[...]]`
> - Different syntax rules apply within the square brackets
> - The `\*` means that we want to match any string, including the empty string
> - A ? sign would match any single character
> - `[...]` matches any single character within the square brackets

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is not a regular expression!
> - Also, more complex pattern matching is available: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern- Matching.html

## Regular expressions

- We can also check for a regular expression: `[["file.txt" =~ \.txt$]]`
- Here, we check that the variable filename ends with `.txt`, but through a regular expression.

## Checking files with [[...]]

- We can also check for files: `[[-e "${filename}"]]` (this checks if the file exists)
- What options do we have?
  - `-e`: File exists
  - `-f`: Regular file
  - `-d`: Directory
  - `-r`: Readable
  - `-w`: Writable
  - `-x`: Executable

## Numeric tests

- To compare numbers, we have several options:
- We can use [[...]] in combination with:
  - `-lt`: Lower than
  - `-le`: Lower than or equal
  - `-gt`: Greater than
  - `-ge`: Greater than or equal
  - Example: `[["${num_files}" -gt 15]]`
- Or we can use an arithmetic expression:
  - `(( num_files > 15 )) `
  - Remember:
    - Within arithmetic expression, different syntax rules apply
    - We can access variables without a $

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This does not work: `[["${num_files}" > 15]]` as in `[[...]]`, the `>` operator performs lexicographical comparison, not numeric comparison

## More complex conditions

- Negation: `!:` negate a condition. Example: `[[! -e "${filename}"]]`
- Logical Operators: We can also combine conditions with logical operators:
  - `&&` for a logical AND
  - `||` for a logical OR
- Example:
  ```bash
  num=6;
  # True
  [["${num}" -gt 5 && "${num}" -lt 10]]
  # False
  [["${num}" -gt 10 || "${num}" -lt 0]]
  ```
- But we could also write it like this (only for `&&`):
- [["${num}" -gt 5]] && [["${num}" -lt 10]]

## **_EXERCISE_**

    We want to analyze the eBook of Romeo and Juliet
    - How many lines contain the word "love"?
    - We need a script that:
        + Downloads the eBook file - but only when needed!
        + And then, calculates how many lines contain the word "love" at least 1 time
        + It should print error messages to stderr
        + It should exit with the correct exit code on error

**Solution**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

ebook='https://downloads.codingcoursestv.eu/055%20-%20bash/if/romeo.txt'
filename='romeo.txt'


#Download ebook in a file if it does not exist
if [[ ! -e "$filename" ]] ; then
  echo 'Downloading file...'
  curl -o "$filename" "$ebook" -s
  else echo 'Romeo and Juliette ebook already exists'

  #Check if download was succesfull
  if [[ ! -f "$filename" ]] ; then
    echo 'An error occurred while downloading Romeo and Juliette' >&2
    exit 1
 fi
fi


#Count lines with love
lovelines=$(grep -i "love" "$filename" | wc -l)
echo "Romeo and Juliette has ${lovelines} lines containing the word LOVE"
```

## How not to test: `[, test`

- Unfortunately, there're way more ways to achieve (almost) the same result as with [[...]]. The reason:
  - For an if block, it doesn't matter how the exit code is being generated:
  - `if command; then`
  - It can be generated by the shell construct [[...]], but it can also be a real program

### Programs to run tests

- Those programs are especially:
  - `/bin/[`
  - `/bin/test`
- Because those programs are in our PATH, we can just call them:
  - `[ "${filename}" == 'data.csv' ]`
  - `test "${filename}" == 'data.csv'`
- Or combine them with an if:

  - `if [ "${filename}" == 'data.csv' ]; then`
  - `if test "${filename}" == 'data.csv'; then`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The options that `[` and test support are slightly different than [[...]]
> But we need to be careful:
>
> - Bash is calling an external program here
> - Different rules apply than for [[...]]
> - Also, `[` and test do not support regular expressions

Example:

- `[["${filename}" == *.txt]]`:
  - Because we're using the shell expression [[...]], `*` does not mean for filename expansion, but for pattern matching
- `[ "${filename}" == _.txt ]`
  - Here, we are calling the program called `[`
  - It just happens to require `]` as a last argument
  - `\*.txt` is just a normal shell argument
  - Thus, the following are applied: Filename expansion and word splitting

**Best practice**

- Always prefer `[[...]]` over `[ ... ]` or test
- `[` and `test` work for compatibility reasons
- But for everything "new" (or written in the last 15+ years),
  we should use `[[...]]`.

## The case statement

- Quite often, we want to do multiple pattern matchings after each other, for this, we could use an `if` with many `elif`, though is not very convenient:
- If we only want to do pattern matching, we should prefer using case - case is optimized for this use case

```bash
case expression in
  pattern1)
    # Code to execute if expression matches pattern1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    # Code to execute if expression matches pattern2
    ;;
  pattern3)
    # Code to execute if expression matches pattern3
    ;;
  *)
    # Code to execute if expression does not match any patterns
    ;;
esac
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

read -p  "Introduce your OS system: " os

case "${os}" in
	Mac)
		echo "On a Mac, install manually"
		;;
	Windows)
		echo "change your OS"
		;;
	CentOS)
		echo "You need to use dfn to install this program"
		;;
	*)
		echo "We don't have information about this OS"
		;;
esac

```
