## ENABLE SHARED DIRECTORIES

- Add shared folder with UTM

**TEMPORARY**

- In VM, add a path for creating a shared folder: `sudo mkdir /mnt/shared`
- `$ ls /mnt` >> check

  **(!)** If logged user hasn't got permissions:

  - `$ su -` >> log into root user
  - `$ sudo usermod -aG wheel USERNAME` >> give permissions to user: The wheel group is a special group traditionally used in Unix and Linux systems to control access to superuser privileges.
  - `$ su - USERNAME`

- `$ sudo mount -t virtiofs share /mnt/shared` >> this config won't be available after rebooting the VM. To mount it permanently you need to edit `/etc/fstab`

**PERMANENT**

- `$ sudo gedit /etc/fstab ` >> and paste this in the editor:
- `share	/mnt/shared	virtiofs	rw,nofail	0 0` >> save + exit
