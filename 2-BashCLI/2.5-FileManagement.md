# 2.5. FILE MANAGEMENT

## Organizing files and directories

- `touch` >> create an empty file (or multiple files)

> [!NOTE]
> More precisely: it modifies the timestamp of a file: if the file already exists, only its timestamp will be modified, otherwise, a new (and empty) file is created.

- `mkdir` >> (make directory) create a new directory

- `mv` >> (move) move an existing file to another location. Can also be used to rename an existing file.

- `cp` >> (copy) to copy an existing file

  - `cp -R` copies a whole folder

- `rm` >> (remove) to remove a file (or multiple files at once)

  - for deleting a directory, you need to use the option `â€“r` (works for empty and non-empty directories)
  - `rmdir` (remove directory) >> to delete an empty directory (if there are hidden files, it won't be deleted neither)

### Filename expansion (globbing)
