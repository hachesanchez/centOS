# 2.5. FILE MANAGEMENT

## Organizing files and directories

- `touch` >> create an empty file (or multiple files)

> [!NOTE]
> More precisely: it modifies the timestamp of a file: if the file already exists, only its timestamp will be modified, otherwise, a new (and empty) file is created.

- `mkdir` >> (make directory) create a new directory
- `mv` >> (move) move an existing file to another location. Can also be used to rename an existing file.
- `cp` >> (copy) to copy an existing file
  - `cp -R` copies a whole folder
- `rm` >> (remove) to remove a file (or multiple files at once)
  - for deleting a directory, you need to use the option `–r` (works for empty and non-empty directories)
  - `rmdir` (remove directory) >> to delete an empty directory (if there are hidden files, it won't be deleted neither)

## Filename expansion (globbing)

Bash can rewrite our command before it is being executed. Globbing recognizes and expands pre-defined wildcard characters, it will then search for files that match this pattern and expand (rewrite) our command.

- This allows us to easily access multiple files
- Wildcard character: `*` Matches 0 to any number of characters

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The wildcard characters must not be quoted (so neither in 'single quotes' nor "double quotes")
  > Globbing does not use regular expressions

  **Additional ways to use globbing**

- `?` >> matches any single character
- `[0-9]` >> The square brackets allow us to specify a character
  range (here: all numbers).

       - Eg. `echo [iI][mM][gG]2*` (will print for all `img2_.jpg` or `IMG2_.jpg` files in every directory)

- `**` >> matches zero up to arbitrarily many characters (including `/`).

       - Eg. `echo **/*.jpg` (will search for all `.jpg` files in every directory)

- Only supported in Bash 4.0 or higher! It might be necessary to enable this: `shopt -s globstar`

> [!CAUTION]
> Bash doesn't differentiate between a folder and a parameter ► And a name of a file may be interpreted as a parameter
> It can be dangerous especially if a file has a name such as: `-rf`:
> If we then execute` rm _` in that folder:
> ► 1.: The `_` will be expanded, so -`rf` will appear in the command
> ► 2.: rm will think that -rf is a parameter (-r means: recursive; -f means: don't ask)
> So, we should prefer globbing with ./`_` over `_`
