# 2.2. USER MANAGEMENT

- System accounts:

  - They are responsible for running background tasks on your system (such as: webserver, database,...)
  - They don't have a home directory

- Regular users:

  - They have access to their own files and directories
  - They cannot perform administrative tasks or access other user's files without permission

- Superuser (root):

  - The superuser (root) has unrestricted access to the entire system (including files in the home directories of regular users)
  - Can add / remove users, install software
  - Can change the configuration of the system

## Elevating privilages

`$ sudo ls /root ` >> sudo elevates privilages

> [!CAUTION]
> Some commands with sudo can be dangerous:
> `sudo rm -rf /etc` >> will erase the VM

**Troubleshooting: If `sudo` doesn't work**

- Turn the user into a regular user (but with "Administrative" rights)
