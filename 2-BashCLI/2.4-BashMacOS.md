# Bash in MacOS

- Comes pre-installed on macOS, but we can just use it in the built-in Terminal app
- Bash is an open-source project released under the GPL license

**The issue:**

- Version 3.x, Bash was being released under the GPLv2 license
- Starting at Version 4.x, Bash switched to GPLv3 and Apple does not include GPLv3 software in their OS (probably due to licensing issues)

**SOLUTION:**

- Bash 3.x is pre-installed on macOS, even though it is quite outdated and Z shell (Zsh) is the default shell for new installations.

1. Install Homebrew (package manager): `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. `brew update`
3. `brew install bash`
4. `brew upgrade`
5. `bash`
6. `echo "${BASH_VERSION}"` // `echo $SHELL`
